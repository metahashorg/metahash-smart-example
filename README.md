# metahash-smart-example

This repository contains the source code of the contract's example in the MetaHash network.

[Example_Contract_Code.js](https://github.com/metahashorg/metahash-smart-example/blob/master/Example_Contract_Code.js) contains examples of contract constructor and contract methods. You can enter the file text into the JAVASCRIPT CONTRACT SOURCE CODE field to create your own contract using this example.

By following this [link](https://github.com/metahashorg/metahash-smart-example/tree/master/testpage_sourcecode) you find a page source code that displays an example of the contract. Contract tokens distributed among wallets are presented here in form of a histogram. Using this example you can create similar pages for your own contracts.
